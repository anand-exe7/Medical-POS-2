- Browser `localStorage` for data persistence (no external DB required)
- lucide-react (icons)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd PMBJK-Makkal-Marundhagam-POS
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSCODE=your-admin-passcode
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAFF_PASSCODE=your-staff-passcode
```

> Note: the app runs entirely in the browser (no server DB), so passcodes are read as `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars. They ship in the client bundle — treat them as UI gates, not real secrets.

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

- Public store page: `/`
- POS terminal: `/pos/admin/secure/control-panel/pmbjk-makkal-marundhagam`
- Digital invoice: `/invoice/[invoice-id]`

## Data Storage

All data (products, customers, orders, order items) is persisted in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `pmbjk_makkal_marundhagam_store_v1`. No external database is required.

Because the store lives in the browser, data is per-device — clearing browser data will wipe it. For multi-device sync, plug in a real backend by swapping `lib/dbStore.ts` for a remote implementation with the same API surface.

## Roles

- **Staff** — Billing Panel, Order History, Stock Alerts (view-only).
- **Admin** — Full access, including Inventory CRUD, Analytics Dashboard, and delete permissions.

The role is determined by which passcode is used to log in.
